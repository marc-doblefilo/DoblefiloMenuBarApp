SystemKit
=========

An OS X system library in Swift based off of
[libtop](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/top/top-100.1.2/libtop.c), from
Apple's top implementation.

- For an example usage of this library, see
  [dshb](https://github.com/beltex/dshb), an OS X system monitor in Swift
- For other system related statistics in Swift for OS X, see
  [SMCKit](https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit)


### Requirements

- [Xcode 6.3.2](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
- OS X 10.9+
    - This is due to Swift
